# Portfolio Story: Data Job Market Skill Analysis

---

## Why I Built This Project

Entry-level data portfolios often show clean datasets and obvious charts. Real work doesn’t. Job-market data is messy, inconsistent, and full of vague labels.

I built this project to answer one practical question:
**What skills actually differentiate Data Analysts, Data Scientists, and ML Engineers in real job postings?**

---

## The Problem

Companies list dozens of skills per job, often bundled into a single field. Titles vary wildly. Salary data is duplicated and noisy. Without careful processing, any conclusions would be misleading.

---

## My Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicate salary entries
   - Standardized job titles into three roles
   - Split and normalized multi-skill job listings

2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Identified most frequent skills overall
   - Compared skill demand across roles
   - Visualized patterns using bar charts and heatmaps

3. **Interpretation Over Decoration**
   - Avoided misleading averages
   - Used frequency-based insights where appropriate
   - Documented assumptions and limitations

---

## Key Findings

- **Data Analysts** prioritize querying, spreadsheets, and visualization tools
- **Data Scientists** focus on Python, machine learning, and statistical methods
- **ML Engineers** emphasize deployment, deep learning frameworks, and production tools

The heatmap visualization clearly shows increasing technical specialization as roles become more engineering-focused.

## Salary Perspective

While skill demand explains *what* employers want, salary analysis provides insight into *how roles are valued* in the market.

Median salary comparisons show that ML Engineers command the highest compensation, followed by Data Scientists, with Data Analysts earning less on average. However, experience level plays a more significant role than job title alone. Salary distributions widen substantially at senior levels, indicating that progression and responsibility have a greater impact on earnings than role transitions alone.

This reinforces the importance of long-term skill development and experience accumulation rather than focusing solely on job titles.

## Business & Career Relevance

This analysis helps:
- Job seekers target skill development more strategically
- Recruiters understand role differentiation
- Organizations design clearer job descriptions

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Real-world data cleaning
- Handling multi-valued categorical data
- Thoughtful EDA and visualization choices
- Clear communication of insights

---

## What I Would Do Next

- Add time-based trend analysis
- Segment skills by region
- Build a recommendation system for skill learning paths

This project reflects how I approach ambiguous data problems: carefully, honestly, and with a focus on decisions rather than just charts.
